thinking about the immortality of the crab
fingering you back
find / | grep -i 'where the fuck are you hiding'
find / | grep -i 'you can run but you can\'t hide, bitch'
listening to your tcp requests
shitposting on the clearnet
sending virtual hugs over UDP
traveling at a constant velocity forward in the dimention of time
sudo rm-rfing your root
deleting system32
swearing at javascript
compiling
studying the anime
connecting to the wired
piloting the evas
destroying discord
playing the nintendos
hacking the facebooks
rearranging the fabric of reality
bogosorting ur mom
shouting at clouds
overthrowing the CAs
